## **Just the basics of what I think a Thirdperson Character should have**

### **This project serves as a place to experiment with ideas and systems that I want to learn and possibly put into a games.**

###  **I think of it as a repository for template code/ideas that can be polished and customized for whatever game I am trying to make at the time**

This is a public code based for any systems, character classes, and functionality that I make. I will use this as a sort of testing ground for assets and ideas before I incorporate them into a more serious project. - StewartMckenzie/UnrealSandBox
